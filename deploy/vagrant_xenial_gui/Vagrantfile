    The presence of this file means that the vagrant virtual machine did not
    finish provisioning correctly.
    The best way to get to a working machine state is to backup any data that
    you want to keep from this virtual machine, and then destroy and re-create
    this vagrant virtual machine by running these commands from your host:
        vagrant destroy
        vagrant up

    xForge Development Machine

    Your git user and email should have been set from your host machine.

    See the xForge Project Workflow gdoc for setting developer secrets,
    Paratext account setup, enabling multiple monitors in VirtualBox, etc.

    You may find it helpful to increase the amount of RAM your virtual machine
    is given, by increasing 'vb.memory' in 'Vagrantfile', then running
    'vagrant halt && vagrant up' from your host.

    You may also find it helpful to enable 3D and increase video RAM by doing
    the following. This can allow larger display resolutions, and might ease
    Unity/Compiz CPU usage. Shut down the virtual machine. Open its Settings
    in VirtualBox Manager. In the Display area, set Video Memory to 64 MB and
    select Enable 3D Acceleration.
