    <verse number="5" style="v" />There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife <char style="add">was</char> of the daughters of Aaron, and her name <char style="add">was</char> Elisabeth. <verse number="6" style="v" />And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. <verse number="7" style="v" />And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were <char style="add">now</char> well stricken in years. <verse number="8" style="v" />And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course, <verse number="9" style="v" />According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. <verse number="10" style="v" />And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. <verse number="11" style="v" />And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. <verse number="12" style="v" />And when Zacharias saw <char style="add">him,</char> he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. <verse number="13" style="v" />But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. <verse number="14" style="v" />And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth. <verse number="15" style="v" />For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb. <verse number="16" style="v" />And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. <verse number="17" style="v" />And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. <verse number="18" style="v" />And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. <verse number="19" style="v" />And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. <verse number="20" style="v" />And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. <verse number="21" style="v" />And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple. <verse number="22" style="v" />And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless. <verse number="23" style="v" />And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. <verse number="24" style="v" />And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, <verse number="25" style="v" />Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on <char style="add">me,</char> to take away my reproach among men. <verse number="26" style="v" />And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, <verse number="27" style="v" />To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name <char style="add">was</char> Mary. <verse number="28" style="v" />And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, <char style="add">thou that art </char> highly favoured, the Lord <char style="add">is</char> with thee: blessed <char style="add">art </char> thou among women. <verse number="29" style="v" />And when she saw <char style="add">him,</char> she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. <verse number="30" style="v" />And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. <verse number="31" style="v" />And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. <verse number="32" style="v" />He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: <verse number="33" style="v" />And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. <verse number="34" style="v" />Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? <verse number="35" style="v" />And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. <verse number="36" style="v" />And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. <verse number="37" style="v" />For with God nothing shall be impossible. <verse number="38" style="v" />And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. <verse number="39" style="v" />And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; <verse number="40" style="v" />And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. <verse number="41" style="v" />And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: <verse number="42" style="v" />And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed <char style="add">art </char> thou among women, and blessed <char style="add">is</char> the fruit of thy womb. <verse number="43" style="v" />And whence <char style="add">is</char> this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <verse number="44" style="v" />For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. <verse number="45" style="v" />And blessed <char style="add">is</char> she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. <verse number="46" style="v" />And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, <verse number="47" style="v" />And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. <verse number="48" style="v" />For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. <verse number="49" style="v" />For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy <char style="add">is </char> his name. <verse number="50" style="v" />And his mercy <char style="add">is</char> on them that fear him from generation to generation. <verse number="51" style="v" />He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. <verse number="52" style="v" />He hath put down the mighty from <char style="add">their</char> seats, and exalted them of low degree. <verse number="53" style="v" />He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. <verse number="54" style="v" />He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of <char style="add">his </char> mercy; <verse number="55" style="v" />As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever. <verse number="56" style="v" />And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house. <verse number="57" style="v" />Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. <verse number="58" style="v" />And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her. <verse number="59" style="v" />And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. <verse number="60" style="v" />And his mother answered and said, Not <char style="add">so;</char> but he shall be called John. <verse number="61" style="v" />And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. <verse number="62" style="v" />And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. <verse number="63" style="v" />And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all. <verse number="64" style="v" />And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue <char style="add">loosed, </char> and he spake, and praised God. <verse number="65" style="v" />And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. <verse number="66" style="v" />And all they that heard <char style="add">them</char> laid <char style="add">them</char> up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him. <verse number="67" style="v" />And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, <verse number="68" style="v" />Blessed <char style="add">be</char> the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people, <verse number="69" style="v" />And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David; <verse number="70" style="v" />As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began: <verse number="71" style="v" />That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; <verse number="72" style="v" />To perform the mercy <char style="add">promised</char> to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; <verse number="73" style="v" />The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, <verse number="74" style="v" />That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, <verse number="75" style="v" />In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. <verse number="76" style="v" />And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; <verse number="77" style="v" />To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins, <verse number="78" style="v" />Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us, <verse number="79" style="v" />To give light to them that sit in darkness and <char style="add">in</char> the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. <verse number="80" style="v" />And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" />And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. <verse number="2" style="v" />(<char style="add">And</char> this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) <verse number="3" style="v" />And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. <verse number="4" style="v" />And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) <verse number="5" style="v" />To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. <verse number="6" style="v" />And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. <verse number="7" style="v" />And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. <verse number="8" style="v" />And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. <verse number="9" style="v" />And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. <verse number="10" style="v" />And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. <verse number="11" style="v" />For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. <verse number="12" style="v" />And this <char style="add">shall be</char> a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. <verse number="13" style="v" />And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, <verse number="14" style="v" />Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. <verse number="15" style="v" />And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. <verse number="16" style="v" />And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. <verse number="17" style="v" />And when they had seen <char style="add">it,</char> they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. <verse number="18" style="v" />And all they that heard <char style="add">it</char> wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. <verse number="19" style="v" />But Mary kept all these things, and pondered <char style="add">them</char> in her heart. <verse number="20" style="v" />And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. <verse number="21" style="v" />And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. <verse number="22" style="v" />And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present <char style="add">him</char> to the Lord;

<verse number="32" style="v" />A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. <verse number="33" style="v" />And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him. <verse number="34" style="v" />And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this <char style="add">child</char> is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel;

    <verse number="1" style="v" />Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, <verse number="2" style="v" />Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. <verse number="3" style="v" />And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; <verse number="4" style="v" />As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. <verse number="5" style="v" />Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways <char style="add">shall be</char> made smooth; <verse number="6" style="v" />And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. <verse number="7" style="v" />Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <verse number="8" style="v" />Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to <char style="add">our</char> father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. <verse number="9" style="v" />And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. <verse number="10" style="v" />And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? <verse number="11" style="v" />He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. <verse number="12" style="v" />Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what shall we do? <verse number="13" style="v" />And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. <verse number="14" style="v" />And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse <char style="add">any </char> falsely; and be content with your wages. <verse number="15" style="v" />And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; <verse number="16" style="v" />John answered, saying unto <char style="add">them</char> all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire: <verse number="17" style="v" />Whose fan <char style="add">is</char> in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable. <verse number="18" style="v" />And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people. <verse number="19" style="v" />But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, <verse number="20" style="v" />Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison. <verse number="21" style="v" />Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, <verse number="22" style="v" />And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son;
