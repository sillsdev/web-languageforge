 *
 * The idea is that this works with the current Javascript Error mechanism as a complement to it. Exceptions and Errors
 * are meant to co-exist - in fact all Exceptions really do is throw Errors and provide a well defined means to compare
 * Errors within a catch block (for example).
 *
 * Hopefully the list of static common Exception instances will grow over time.
