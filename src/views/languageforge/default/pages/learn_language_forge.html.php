			<h2>About Language Forge</h2>

            <p>Imagine being able to upload your lexicon data to the internet and access it online anytime, anywhere with no extra software.  Now imagine that you could give a colleague secure access to your data just by emailing them a link.  With Language Forge, this is just the beginning!</p>

            <p>It’s easy to get started quickly, just login and create your first project. Start by uploading a LIFT file of your lexicon data.</p>

            <p>Language Forge has fine-grained configuration options. You can choose which fields you want to see and which fields use which input systems.  Add new languages to any field in the Input Systems area.  Support for complex scripts and right-to-left languages is built-in.  Customize the behavior of each field in the “Fields” section.  Specify who can see what fields in the “View Settings”.  Choose what role each member of your project will have: Observer, Commenter, Contributor or Manager.</p>

            <p>It’s easy to add members to your project.  Search by name for existing Language Forge users or invite colleagues to your Language Forge project via email. You choose with whom you share your data and to what extent.</p>

            <p>Not only can you share your data, but you can invite others to give feedback on all aspects of your lexical data.  Commenters can have detailed discussions about any entry and any field in the lexicon.  Field context can optionally be attached to any comment, showing what the value of a field was at the time the comment was made.  Commenters can reply to existing comments inline, or add their own responses.  Managers can organize and search comments.  Comments can be marked TODO or marked as RESOLVED to close a discussion.</p>

            <p>Send/Receive support with other programs such as FLEX and WeSay is not yet available but is coming soon.  Accessing your data offline is also planned for a future release.</p>

            <p>Language Forge can help you share your data online in the way you want to, with the people you want to, using just a web browser.  Give it a try!</p>
