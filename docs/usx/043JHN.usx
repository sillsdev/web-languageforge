    <verse number="1" style="v" />In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <verse number="2" style="v" />The same was in the beginning with God. <verse number="3" style="v" />All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. <verse number="4" style="v" />In him was life; and the life was the light of men. <verse number="5" style="v" />And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />There was a man sent from God, whose name <char style="add">was</char> John. <verse number="7" style="v" />The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all <char style="add">men</char> through him might believe. <verse number="8" style="v" />He was not that Light, but <char style="add">was sent</char> to bear witness of that Light. <verse number="9" style="v" /><char style="add">That</char> was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. <verse number="10" style="v" />He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. <verse number="11" style="v" />He came unto his own, and his own received him not. <verse number="12" style="v" />But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, <char style="add">even</char> to them that believe on his name: <verse number="13" style="v" />Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. <verse number="14" style="v" />And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. <verse number="16" style="v" />And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. <verse number="17" style="v" />For the law was given by Moses, <char style="add">but</char> grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. <verse number="18" style="v" />No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared <char style="add">him</char>.</para>

    <verse number="19" style="v" />And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? <verse number="20" style="v" />And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. <verse number="21" style="v" />And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. <verse number="22" style="v" />Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? <verse number="23" style="v" />He said, I <char style="add">am</char> the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. <verse number="24" style="v" />And they which were sent were of the Pharisees. <verse number="25" style="v" />And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet? <verse number="26" style="v" />John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; <verse number="27" style="v" />He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose. <verse number="28" style="v" />These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="29" style="v" />The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. <verse number="30" style="v" />This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me. <verse number="31" style="v" />And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. <verse number="32" style="v" />And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. <verse number="33" style="v" />And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. <verse number="34" style="v" />And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</para>

Philip saith unto him, Come and see. <verse number="47" style="v" />Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, <char style="wj">Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! </char> <verse number="48" style="v" />Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me?

    <verse number="1" style="v" />And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: <verse number="2" style="v" />And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. <verse number="3" style="v" />And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. <verse number="4" style="v" />Jesus saith unto her, <char style="wj">Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. </char> <verse number="5" style="v" />His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do <char style="add">it. </char> <verse number="6" style="v" />And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. <verse number="7" style="v" />Jesus saith unto them, <char style="wj">Fill the waterpots with water.</char> And they filled them up to the brim. <verse number="8" style="v" />And he saith unto them, <char style="wj">Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.</char> And they bare <char style="add">it. </char> <verse number="9" style="v" />When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, <verse number="10" style="v" />And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: <char style="add">but</char> thou hast kept the good wine until now. <verse number="11" style="v" />This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast <char style="add">day, </char> many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. <verse number="24" style="v" />But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all <char style="add">men, </char> <verse number="25" style="v" />And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</para>
